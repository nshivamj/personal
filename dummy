def evaluate_custom(self, m_id, metric):
    local_vars = {dep: self.results.get(dep, self.input_values.get(dep)) for dep in metric["dependencies"]}
    if "precondition" in metric:
        try:
            if not eval(metric["precondition"], {}, local_vars):
                self.rule_usage[f"{m_id}_precondition_failed"] += 1
                return "N/A"
        except Exception:
            return "N/A"
    func = eval(metric["expression"], {"lookup": self.lookup})
    self.rule_usage[f"{m_id}_custom"] += 1
    return func(**local_vars)
Would you like me to also update your evaluator code with support for this precondition logic and provide the full updated version?







You said:
Is this how u meN becoz u showed me multiple precodition list


ChatGPT said:
Great question.

What I showed you just now is one simple precondition as a string, but you can absolutely make it more structured and powerful by supporting multiple preconditions using a list or a small DSL.

‚úÖ Two Styles of Defining Preconditions
‚úÖ Option 1: Simple (single string)
json
Copy
Edit
"precondition": "N != 'N/A' and Q != 'N/A' and R != 'N/A'"
Easy to use.

Evaluated with Python eval.

Downside: difficult to validate or convert to other engines (like Drools or UI rules).

‚úÖ Option 2: Structured List (recommended for complex or scalable rules)
json
Copy
Edit
"preconditions": [
  {"left": "N", "operator": "!=", "right": "N/A"},
  {"left": "Q", "operator": "!=", "right": "N/A"},
  {"left": "R", "operator": "!=", "right": "N/A"}
]
This is like building a small internal DSL (domain-specific language).

Easier to validate, debug, and convert (to Drools, UI, SQL, etc.).

You can write a small interpreter that evaluates this logic.

Supports future enhancement like grouping with AND/OR, conditions like isNull, etc.

üîß Example Evaluator Support for Structured Preconditions
python
Copy
Edit
def evaluate_preconditions(self, preconditions, local_vars):
    for cond in preconditions:
        left = local_vars.get(cond["left"])
        right = cond["right"]
        op = cond["operator"]
        if op == "!=" and left == right:
            return False
        elif op == "==" and left != right:
            return False
        # Add more operators as needed
    return True
‚úÖ Suggestion for You
If your rules will grow or you'll migrate to something like Drools or want to expose these configs to non-coders, then go for:

preconditions: [...] (structured)

expression: ... (just the logic after conditions are met)

Would you like me to convert your current rule config into this structured format?







You said:
No i mean  should all dependent  N/A checks happen in prevondition


ChatGPT said:
Ah, now I understand your question more clearly.

You're asking:

üß† "Should all the N/A checks (like if N != 'N/A' and Q != 'N/A') be moved out of the lambda expression and instead handled in a separate precondition block?"

‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî That‚Äôs the cleanest and most maintainable way.
By moving N/A checks into a precondition block, you:

Keep business logic clean ‚Äî the lambda expression only deals with actual computation.

Avoid clutter ‚Äî repetitive N/A checks make logic harder to read.

Enable reuse ‚Äî you can re-apply similar preconditions across metrics.

üîÑ Before vs After
‚ùå Current (mixed logic + condition):
json
Copy
Edit
"expression": "lambda N, Q, R: abs((N - Q) - (R - Q)) / 2 if N != 'N/A' and Q != 'N/A' and R != 'N/A' else 'N/A'"
‚úÖ Better (with precondition):
json
Copy
Edit
"precondition": "N != 'N/A' and Q != 'N/A' and R != 'N/A'",
"expression": "lambda N, Q, R: abs((N - Q) - (R - Q)) / 2"
And in Python, the evaluator would be like:

python
Copy
Edit
def evaluate_custom(self, m_id, metric):
    local_vars = {dep: self.results.get(dep, self.input_values.get(dep)) for dep in metric["dependencies"]}
    
    if "precondition" in metric:
        if not eval(metric["precondition"], {}, local_vars):
            return "N/A"
    
    func = eval(metric["expression"], {"lookup": self.lookup})
    self.rule_usage[f"{m_id}_custom"] += 1
    return func(**local_vars)
‚úÖ Summary
Aspect	Inline N/A Check	Separate Precondition ‚úÖ
Logic clarity	‚ùå Mixed	‚úÖ Clean separation
Maintainability	‚ùå Hard to refactor	‚úÖ Easy to manage
Code readability	‚ùå Degrades with nesting	‚úÖ Simple expression logic
Reusability	‚ùå Not reusable	‚úÖ Can abstract

Would you like me to rewrite your config with precondition blocks applied wherever N/A checks are being done?







You said:
I might have diff logoc to do if na


ChatGPT said:
That's a great point ‚Äî and yes, real-world use cases often need different logic paths when N/A is encountered, such as:

If A is N/A, use B.

If both A and B are N/A, return "N/A".

If only one is valid, apply logic to that.

Or sometimes: if any input is N/A, skip evaluation altogether.

üß© So What Are the Options?
Let‚Äôs compare three approaches:

‚úÖ Option 1: Use precondition to skip evaluation entirely
Only evaluate if certain conditions (like A != 'N/A') are met.

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "precondition": "A != 'N/A' and B != 'N/A'",
  "expression": "lambda A, B: (A + B) / 2"
}
If precondition fails ‚Üí return 'N/A'.

‚úÖ Option 2: Build the logic into expression
This gives flexibility if different behavior is needed when N/A is encountered:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "expression": "lambda A, B: A if B == 'N/A' else B if A == 'N/A' else (A + B)/2"
}
Pros:

Full control over fallback logic.
Cons:

Expression can get hard to read quickly.

‚úÖ Option 3: Introduce a fallback_logic key (custom DSL idea)
You can define rules like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "dependencies": ["A", "B"],
  "fallback_logic": [
    { "condition": "A == 'N/A' and B != 'N/A'", "return": "B" },
    { "condition": "B == 'N/A' and A != 'N/A'", "return": "A" },
    { "condition": "A != 'N/A' and B != 'N/A'", "expression": "lambda A, B: (A + B) / 2" }
  ]
}
Your Python code can then:

Check each fallback_logic condition in order.

If matched, return the result or evaluate expression.

This is more verbose, but super flexible and readable.

‚úÖ Recommended Strategy
If the logic is simple, use precondition + expression.

If the logic is dependent on multiple fallback branches, use fallback_logic as a richer construct.

Avoid overloading your lambdas with too many inline ternaries ‚Äî keep logic readable.

Would you like an example of how to extend your evaluator to support fallback_logic in Python?







You said:
I like option 3
But this as a fallback logox , can we name something else or like an order

And anu better way so tht i avoid a==na


ChatGPT said:
Excellent ‚Äî glad you liked Option 3! You're right ‚Äî we can definitely improve the structure and naming for clarity and elegance.

‚úÖ Rename fallback_logic ‚Üí evaluation_chain (or rules)
This feels more intent-driven: it's a chain of rules to evaluate, with conditions + return values or an expression.

‚úÖ Avoid repeating "A == 'N/A'" ‚Äî use shorthand like:
json
Copy
Edit
"condition": "valid(A) and not valid(B)"
Then in Python, define valid(x) as:

python
Copy
Edit
def valid(x): return x != 'N/A' and x is not None
‚úÖ Final JSON Structure (Clean + Expressive):
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "type": "custom_chain",
  "dependencies": ["A", "B"],
  "evaluation_chain": [
    {
      "condition": "not valid(A) and valid(B)",
      "return": "B"
    },
    {
      "condition": "valid(A) and not valid(B)",
      "return": "A"
    },
    {
      "condition": "valid(A) and valid(B)",
      "expression": "lambda A, B: (A + B) / 2"
    },
    {
      "condition": "True",  // fallback
      "return": "'N/A'"
    }
  ]
}
You can then make the evaluator do:

Loop through each evaluation_chain rule.

Evaluate the condition.

If matched:

Use return if it exists.

Else evaluate expression.

‚úÖ Benefits
Modular: handles N/A, multiple fallbacks, or even deeply nested strategies.

Cleaner logic: avoids redundant ternary mess.

Extendable: you could later add priorities or audit trail labels per rule.

üõ† Python Changes Needed?
Yes ‚Äî only small additions:

Add custom_chain evaluator.

Define valid() in the eval context.

Loop over evaluation_chain.

Would you like the updated Python code for this evaluator type?







You said:
Any beter way


ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî here's a cleaner and more expressive approach to represent complex conditional logic, including fallback handling, without hardcoding "A == 'N/A'" checks or repeating logic.

‚úÖ Recommended Strategy: rule_chain with built-in valid() helper
Instead of using raw Python expressions in "condition" or lambdas, define your rule in a structured declarative format like this:

‚úÖ JSON Rule Format (Structured, Clear, No Lambdas):
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "type": "rule_chain",
  "dependencies": ["A", "B"],
  "rules": [
    {
      "if": {"A": "N/A", "B!": "N/A"},
      "then": "B"
    },
    {
      "if": {"A!": "N/A", "B": "N/A"},
      "then": "A"
    },
    {
      "if": {"A!": "N/A", "B!": "N/A"},
      "compute": "mean(A, B)"
    },
    {
      "otherwise": "N/A"
    }
  ]
}
‚úÖ Explanation of Condition Syntax:
"A" means A == 'N/A'

"A!" means A != 'N/A' (i.e. valid)

"compute" allows specifying a named function like "mean(A, B)"

‚úÖ Benefits of This Format:
Feature	Why It Helps
‚úÖ No raw lambdas	Safer and more portable
‚úÖ Declarative conditions	Easy to read, edit, audit
‚úÖ Named expressions	Enables central function repo (e.g. mean)
‚úÖ Clear fallback	"otherwise" as final fallback

‚úÖ Evaluator Function Needs to Support:
Parsing rules[] in order

Resolving if conditions using a simple helper

Evaluating "then" or "compute" using safe logic

üõ† Example Python Helper Functions:
python
Copy
Edit
def is_valid(x):
    return x != 'N/A' and x is not None

def evaluate_condition(conds, context):
    for k, v in conds.items():
        key = k.replace("!", "")
        val = context.get(key, 'N/A')
        if "!" in k:
            if not is_valid(val):
                return False
        else:
            if not (val == 'N/A'):
                return False
    return True

def mean(*args):
    vals = [v for v in args if is_valid(v)]
    return sum(vals) / len(vals) if vals else 'N/A'
‚úÖ Want Me to Convert Your Current Config to This Format?
I can help translate your full rule_config into this format if you want to proceed. Would you like that?







You said:
Apply in my rule config


ChatGPT said:
Edited
‚úÖ I've updated your code to support more structured precondition handling with rule_chain, making your configuration cleaner and extensible. Now, fallback and condition-based logic is defined explicitly in config using "if" and "otherwise" blocks instead of cluttered lambdas.

Next, I can refactor your current rule config into this structure‚Äîwould you like me to proceed with that transformation?

üîß What‚Äôs New & Better:
rule_chain structure lets you define multiple condition-evaluation paths per metric.

"if" and "otherwise" give clear, readable fallback behavior.

No need for inline lambda or eval if handled using safe_eval (already done in code).

Readable and maintainable for both technical and business users.

‚úÖ Let me know if you want:

A function to automatically convert old-style "expression": "lambda..." to this format.

Updates to your Python evaluator to use this rule_chain format end-to-end.

Would you like to proceed with that refactor?

‚úÖ Updated your rule config and evaluator to support rule_chain with precondition logic in a cleaner format.

Now, your config uses:

"type": "rule_chain"

rules with if, then, compute, and otherwise

! suffix to mean not equal to 'N/A'

Also, the evaluator supports mean and fallback behavior.

Let me know if you want:

to support more compute expressions (e.g., sum, min)

or to show how to visualize rule paths used.





You said:
In metric V

I guess rile was if lookup t,p =T then s 


ChatGPT said:
You're absolutely right!

The rule in metric V was meant to behave like:

"If lookup(T, P) == T, then use S; else use O."

So, in the new rule_chain format, the correct equivalent representation would look like this:

json
Copy
Edit
"V": {
  "type": "rule_chain",
  "dependencies": ["T", "P", "S", "O"],
  "rules": [
    {
      "if": {"lookup(T,P)": "T"},
      "then": "S"
    },
    {
      "otherwise": "O"
    }
  ]
}
üîß Notes:
lookup(T,P) is treated as a callable function inside the evaluator. You must ensure the evaluator understands "lookup(T,P)" as a valid function call in if expressions.

If you'd rather avoid the need to parse a string like "lookup(T,P)", an alternative would be to refactor the config slightly:

json
Copy
Edit
"V": {
  "type": "custom",
  "dependencies": ["T", "P", "S", "O"],
  "expression": "lambda T, P, S, O: S if lookup(T, P) == T else O"
}
But if you want to fully embrace the rule_chain approach, then the evaluator must support mini-functions like lookup(a, b) inside conditions.

Would you like me to modify your evaluator so that it supports calling simple functions like lookup(T, P) inside the if block of a rule_chain rule?







You said:
How to have sich that i dnt hv then
Its like if precondition compute


ChatGPT said:
Great question! You're referring to rules where you want to compute the result directly if a condition is met, without explicitly having a then. Instead of:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "if": {...},
  "then": "some_variable"
}
You want something like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "if": {...},
  "compute": "some_expression"
}
This allows for on-the-fly computation when conditions are met.

‚úÖ Recommended Format for This Pattern
Here‚Äôs a clean, flexible structure:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "type": "rule_chain",
  "dependencies": ["A", "B"],
  "rules": [
    {
      "if": {"A": "N/A", "B!": "N/A"},
      "compute": "B"
    },
    {
      "if": {"A!": "N/A", "B": "N/A"},
      "compute": "A"
    },
    {
      "if": {"A!": "N/A", "B!": "N/A"},
      "compute": "mean(A, B)"
    },
    {
      "otherwise": "N/A"
    }
  ]
}
üß† Notes:
The compute field can be:

A literal variable name (like "B" or "A"),

A function-like expression (e.g., "mean(A, B)"),

Or even a lambda-style inline expression (if your evaluator supports it).

Your evaluator should resolve variables and execute simple functions like mean, abs, lookup, etc.

üéØ Why this is useful:
It lets you express fallbacks and logic compactly:

json
Copy
Edit
"rules": [
  { "if": {"A!": "N/A", "B!": "N/A"}, "compute": "A + B" },
  { "if": {"A!": "N/A"}, "compute": "A" },
  { "otherwise": "N/A" }
]
‚úÖ Summary
then: means take the value of another metric.

compute: means compute based on current values.

Use "otherwise": "N/A" as fallback.

Would you like me to update your evaluator to handle this "compute" logic inside rule_chain?







You said:
Limitation??


ChatGPT said:
Excellent ‚Äî considering the "rule_chain" with "compute" logic is powerful, but it has some limitations you should be aware of:

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of Using compute in rule_chain
Aspect	Limitation	Notes
Expression Parsing	Complex compute expressions need parsing or eval	E.g., "mean(A, B)", "abs(X - Y)", etc. need a parser or safe eval
Function Support	You must predefine all functions like mean, lookup, abs	Cannot call arbitrary Python unless you whitelist
Error Handling	If required values are N/A, compute might crash unless checked	E.g., "A + B" will fail if A or B is "N/A"
Order Dependency	Depends on correct evaluation order of A, B, etc.	Must ensure via topological sort
Security	Unsafe if compute is evaluated using eval() directly from config	You must sanitize or replace with a function registry
Debuggability	Harder to trace/debug nested compute expressions	Especially when results go wrong or depend on indirect logic
Limited Nesting	Harder to nest rule chains or compute inside compute	Can be solved, but needs extra complexity
No Intermediate State	You can't reuse partial computation (unless you add more metrics)	So reuse means more nodes or duplication

‚úÖ Mitigations
Limitation	Mitigation
Complex expressions	Use helper functions like mean(A,B), safe_div, is_na, and register them
Security of eval	Use a function registry instead of raw eval()
Missing value protection	Add "if" checks before compute
Debuggability	Log which rule fired, and include values in logs
Expression parsing	Use ast.literal_eval + your own function engine, or a mini DSL

üß† Example: Safe compute Using Function Registry
python
Copy
Edit
SAFE_FUNCS = {
    "mean": lambda a, b: (a + b) / 2,
    "abs": abs,
    "is_na": lambda x: x == "N/A"
}
Then your compute: "mean(A, B)" is parsed and executed using only SAFE_FUNCS.

üëå When to Use This
Use compute when:

You want to avoid writing many intermediary metrics.

Your logic is short and composable.

You‚Äôre handling simple condition-then-compute logic.

You want to consolidate fallback logic in one place.

If your use case grows into many deeply nested computations, consider:

Breaking logic into smaller metrics,

Introducing functions block in your config,

Or eventually evaluating external logic (Python or Drools).

Would you like a function-based evaluator for compute instead of eval for better safety and modularity?







You said:
Yah i want to break ata level of small func


ChatGPT said:
Great ‚Äî you're aiming for modular, safe, and reusable logic, and that‚Äôs absolutely the right direction. Here's how you can break your logic into small named functions and reference them from your config.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step Plan to Modularize Rule Logic
1. Create a Function Registry
This holds reusable logic, instead of putting lambdas or eval() inside config.

python
Copy
Edit
# function_registry.py
def abs_val(x):
    return abs(x)

def is_positive(x):
    return x > 0

def mean(a, b):
    return (a + b) / 2

def lookup(t, p):
    return t if t == p else p

def custom_logic_x(m, w):
    return "GMS" if lookup(m, w) == m else "NII" if lookup(m, w) == w else "N/A"

def custom_logic_ab(x, m, w):
    return m if x == "GMS" else w if x == "NII" else "N/A"

def safe_div_diff(n, q, r):
    return abs((n - q) - (r - q)) / 2 if all(v != "N/A" for v in [n, q, r]) else "N/A"
2. Update Your Rule Config to Use Function Names
Instead of using "expression": "lambda X, Y: ...", use:

json
Copy
Edit
"expression": "abs_val"
or

json
Copy
Edit
"expression": "custom_logic_ab"
3. Update Evaluator to Use the Registry
Modify your evaluator to import from the registry:

python
Copy
Edit
from function_registry import *
SAFE_FUNCS = {
    "abs_val": abs_val,
    "is_positive": is_positive,
    "mean": mean,
    "lookup": lookup,
    "custom_logic_x": custom_logic_x,
    "custom_logic_ab": custom_logic_ab,
    "safe_div_diff": safe_div_diff,
    # Add more here as needed
}
Then inside the evaluator:

python
Copy
Edit
def evaluate_custom(self, m_id, metric):
    local_vars = {dep: self.results.get(dep, self.input_values.get(dep)) for dep in metric["dependencies"]}
    func_name = metric["expression"]
    func = SAFE_FUNCS[func_name]
    self.rule_usage[f"{m_id}_custom"] += 1
    return func(**local_vars)
‚úÖ Final Config Example (Modular Form)
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "metrics": {
    "K": { "type": "custom", "dependencies": ["J"], "expression": "abs_val" },
    "L": { "type": "custom", "dependencies": ["K"], "expression": "is_positive" },
    "M": { "type": "threshold", "dependencies": ["L"], "expression": [50000000, 200000000, 800000000] },
    "O": { "type": "custom", "dependencies": ["N"], "expression": "abs_val" },
    "O1": { "type": "custom", "dependencies": ["O"], "expression": "is_positive" },
    "P": { "type": "threshold", "dependencies": ["O1"], "expression": [800000000, 5000000000, 10000000000] },
    "S": { "type": "custom", "dependencies": ["N", "Q", "R"], "expression": "safe_div_diff" },
    "T": { "type": "threshold", "dependencies": ["S"], "expression": [500000000, 800000000, 5000000000] },
    "U": { "type": "custom", "dependencies": ["Q"], "expression": "is_positive" },
    "V": { "type": "custom", "dependencies": ["T", "P", "S", "O"], "expression": "lookup" },
    "W": { "type": "custom", "dependencies": ["T", "P", "S", "V"], "expression": "lookup" },
    "X": { "type": "custom", "dependencies": ["M", "W"], "expression": "custom_logic_x" },
    "AB": { "type": "custom", "dependencies": ["X", "M", "W"], "expression": "custom_logic_ab" }
  }
}
üß† Benefits of This Pattern
Feature	Benefit
üîê No eval()	Safe, no code injection risk
üîÑ Reuse	Logic reused across rules
üß± Modularity	Easier to test each function individually
üß∞ Extendable	You can easily build more complex logic with helper utils

Would you like me to refactor your existing rule config and evaluator fully into this function-based modular format with full code?







You said:
i undertsand rule chain ,

i aso hv logic like

A=yes and B!=N/A then B else C


ChatGPT said:
Great! You're dealing with a conditional evaluation that combines explicit checks and fallback logic.

Your logic:

If A == 'yes' and B != 'N/A' then B, else C

can be elegantly expressed using the rule chain pattern you mentioned earlier.

‚úÖ How to Express This in Rule Chain Format
Here‚Äôs how your rule would look in JSON-based rule chain syntax:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "type": "rule_chain",
  "dependencies": ["A", "B", "C"],
  "rules": [
    {
      "if": {
        "A": "yes",
        "B!": "N/A"
      },
      "then": "B"
    },
    {
      "otherwise": "C"
    }
  ]
}
üîç Explanation
"A": "yes" ‚Üí means A must be "yes"

"B!": "N/A" ‚Üí means B must not be "N/A"

"then": "B" ‚Üí return B's value if above condition is true

"otherwise": "C" ‚Üí fallback to C if the if condition fails

üß© In Python Evaluator
You can use your rule chain evaluator logic, which interprets if, then, compute, and otherwise keys.

Here‚Äôs a small example how this rule chain can be evaluated inside your evaluate_rule_chain function:

python
Copy
Edit
def evaluate_rule_chain(self, m_id, metric):
    rules = metric["rules"]
    local_vars = {dep: self.results.get(dep, self.input_values.get(dep)) for dep in metric["dependencies"]}

    for rule in rules:
        if "if" in rule:
            cond_met = True
            for k, v in rule["if"].items():
                negate = False
                if k.endswith("!"):
                    k = k[:-1]
                    negate = True
                val = local_vars.get(k)
                if negate and val == v:
                    cond_met = False
                    break
                elif not negate and val != v:
                    cond_met = False
                    break
            if cond_met:
                if "then" in rule:
                    return local_vars[rule["then"]]
                elif "compute" in rule:
                    return eval(rule["compute"], {}, local_vars)

        elif "otherwise" in rule:
            return local_vars.get(rule["otherwise"])
‚úÖ Summary
Logic	Rule Chain
if A == 'yes' and B != 'N/A' then B else C	"if": { "A": "yes", "B!": "N/A" }, then: B ‚Üí else: C
if A != 'N/A' and B == 'no' then compute something	Use "if" and "compute" block

Would you like me to auto-convert multiple such expressions from lambda-style config into this rule chain format in your evaluator?







You said:
any better way as i might have no control now in how many ifs in rules


ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî you're absolutely right to want more flexibility. When you don't know how many if rules there will be, and you want to manage them cleanly, the current JSON rule_chain approach is good, but it can be made even more extensible and maintainable.

Here‚Äôs how you can take it to the next level:

‚úÖ Recommended Format: Condition List + Action
Make each rule explicit with:

conditions: a list of ANDed conditions (with optional negation)

action: a computed result (via then, return, compute)

an optional fallback at the end

üëá Example
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "type": "rule_chain",
  "dependencies": ["A", "B", "C"],
  "rules": [
    {
      "conditions": [
        { "var": "A", "equals": "yes" },
        { "var": "B", "not_equals": "N/A" }
      ],
      "return": "B"
    },
    {
      "conditions": [
        { "var": "A", "equals": "yes" },
        { "var": "B", "equals": "N/A" }
      ],
      "return": "C"
    },
    {
      "fallback": "N/A"
    }
  ]
}
This is more readable, debuggable, and easier to maintain. You could even add more complex logic (e.g., greater than, in, etc.).

üîß Evaluator Function
Here‚Äôs a flexible Python function to support this format:

python
Copy
Edit
def evaluate_rule_chain(self, m_id, metric):
    rules = metric["rules"]
    local_vars = {dep: self.results.get(dep, self.input_values.get(dep)) for dep in metric["dependencies"]}

    for rule in rules:
        if "conditions" in rule:
            match = True
            for cond in rule["conditions"]:
                var = cond["var"]
                val = local_vars.get(var)
                if "equals" in cond and val != cond["equals"]:
                    match = False
                    break
                if "not_equals" in cond and val == cond["not_equals"]:
                    match = False
                    break
                if "greater_than" in cond and not (val > cond["greater_than"]):
                    match = False
                    break
                if "less_than" in cond and not (val < cond["less_than"]):
                    match = False
                    break
            if match:
                if "return" in rule:
                    return local_vars[rule["return"]]
                elif "compute" in rule:
                    return eval(rule["compute"], {}, local_vars)
        elif "fallback" in rule:
            return rule["fallback"]

    return "N/A"
