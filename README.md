Heuristic Weighting

🔹 Step 1: Define Base Weights
Let’s say you assign default weights for categories (summing to 100%):
Code Generation → 50%


Code Quality → 25%


Code Improvement → 15%


Code Understanding → 10%



🔹 Step 2: Normalize Weights for Selected Categories
When fewer categories are tagged, you re-normalize only among those selected.
👉 Example 1: If a ticket is tagged with [Code Generation, Quality]:
From base weights → Gen = 50, Quality = 25.


Total = 75.


Normalize:


Gen = 50/75 = 66.7%


Quality = 25/75 = 33.3%


So if story points = 10, reduction = 25% (2.5 SP saved):
Gen gets 1.67 SP saved.


Quality gets 0.83 SP saved.



👉 Example 2: If a ticket is tagged with [Improvement, Understanding]:
Base = 15 + 10 = 25.


Normalize:


Improvement = 15/25 = 60%


Understanding = 10/25 = 40%


If story points = 8, reduction = 15% (1.2 SP saved):
Improvement = 0.72 SP.


Understanding = 0.48 SP.



👉 Example 3: If all 4 categories are selected → just use base weights as-is.

🔹 Step 3: Implementation Formula
If SavedPoints = StoryPoints × Reduction%
For each category:
CategorySavedSP = SavedPoints × (CategoryWeight / SumOfSelectedCategoryWeights)


✅ This way:
You avoid equal splits.


You bias attribution to categories that you believe drive more time savings.


You keep results consistent and defensible.


Copilot Adoption & Efficiency Insights Report


1. Adoption by Copilot Category
What it tells us:
 Distribution of usage across categories like code generation, refactoring, documentation, boilerplate, etc.


Insights:


Heavy skew towards certain categories (e.g., boilerplate) suggests untapped potential in advanced areas (e.g., refactoring, test generation).


Some categories may be underutilized simply because devs don’t know they exist.


Next steps:


Provide category-focused training (e.g., “how to use Copilot for test cases”).


Create prompt libraries/templates for underused categories.


Encourage developers to experiment with multiple categories.


Efficiency Mapping:
 Expanding adoption from low-value categories (boilerplate) to high-value ones (test generation/refactoring) increases time savings per ticket.



3. Copilot Category vs. Time Reduced Category
What it tells us:
 Shows which Copilot categories correlate with significant vs. moderate vs. slight time savings.


Insights:


Code generation may consistently drive “significant” savings.


Documentation may be in “slightly reduced” → shows diminishing returns.


Some categories may show inconsistent gains → needs further study.


Next steps:


Prioritize expanding use of categories with high impact correlation (e.g., code generation, test generation).


Reduce reliance on categories with low impact (e.g., documentation).


Track how categories shift over time with training.


Efficiency Mapping:
 Shifting work towards high-impact categories maximizes efficiency per usage hour.



4. Split Across Time Reduced Category (Significant, Moderate, Slight, Not Feasible)
What it tells us:
 Shows distribution of tickets by level of time saved.


Insights:


If many tickets are “slight” → Copilot is being under-leveraged.


If large % are “not feasible” → Copilot applicability may be low or devs aren’t framing prompts correctly.


Next steps:


Investigate why “not feasible” tickets exist (domain complexity, poor prompting, setup issues).


Share prompting best practices to move “slight” → “moderate/significant”.


Track feasibility % per quarter to measure maturity.


Efficiency Mapping:
 Increasing share of “significant” time savings tickets → exponential impact on total efficiency gain.



5. Ticket Size vs. Copilot Category Count
What it tells us:
 Shows if Copilot is being used more on small, medium, or large tickets, and in how many categories.


Insights:


If adoption is skewed towards small tickets → missing efficiency in large/complex tickets.


If larger tickets use multiple categories → shows Copilot’s compound benefits.


Next steps:


Encourage Copilot use in medium/large tickets where returns are higher.


Build guidelines: “Use at least 2 categories (gen + test) for large tickets.”


Measure efficiency per story point bucket.


Efficiency Mapping:
 Shifting Copilot from small → large tickets increases weighted efficiency gains.



6. Total Efficiency Gain
What it tells us:
 Aggregated productivity improvement from Copilot.


Insights:


Quantifies ROI of adoption so far.


Trend over time shows whether efficiency is compounding or stagnating.


Next steps:


Establish a baseline benchmark (e.g., 20% gain).


Track monthly/quarterly growth.


Set target efficiency goals for leadership visibility.


Efficiency Mapping:
 Direct measure of ROI → ties adoption strategy to tangible outcomes.



7. Efficiency by Copilot Usage Category
What it tells us:
 Shows which categories drive the most efficiency.


Insights:


Code generation/test automation often leads in efficiency.


Some categories may have low adoption + low efficiency → candidates for deprioritization.


Next steps:


Focus enablement on categories with high efficiency + medium adoption (growth potential).


Evaluate whether to sunset or de-prioritize low adoption/low efficiency ones.


Efficiency Mapping:
 Better allocation of developer time across categories → maximized ROI.



8. Efficiency by Story Point
What it tells us:
 Maps Copilot impact against ticket size (e.g., 1SP, 3SP, 5SP, 8SP).


Insights:


Small tickets may show marginal benefit → Copilot more valuable in 5SP+ tickets.


Large story points could demonstrate compounding savings.


Next steps:


Prioritize Copilot use on medium-to-large tickets.


Create guidelines: “Copilot is mandatory for 5SP+ stories.”


Efficiency Mapping:
 Focus on story-point weighted efficiency to drive bigger ROI.



9. Efficiency by Ticket Size
What it tells us:
 Direct comparison of efficiency vs. ticket size.


Insights:


Efficiency % may plateau beyond a certain ticket size → diminishing returns.


High adoption in small tickets but low efficiency → wasted effort.


Next steps:


Encourage balanced adoption (not just small tickets).


Study where Copilot doesn’t scale well (very large tickets) → supplement with other techniques.


Efficiency Mapping:
 Aligning Copilot use to optimal ticket size range boosts aggregate ROI.










































Copilot Adoption & Efficiency — 
Executive summary
Adoption is high (68%), and overall efficiency gain is ~7% at the app level.
Biggest ROI categories: Code Improvement (8%) and Code Generation (7%).
By size: Medium & large tickets deliver ~7% efficiency; small tickets lag at ~5%.
Where time savings land today: Mostly slight/moderate reductions; “significant” is only ~7% of issues.
What the data tells us (with takeaways)
1) Adoption by App
Used: 541 (68%) Not used: 267 (32%).
So what: Copilot is embedded in day-to-day flow, but 1 in 3 issues still don’t use it.
Next step: Run a quick scan of “not used” issues to separate not applicable vs missed opportunity and target the latter with prompts/examples.
2) Adoption by Category
Share of issues: Improvement 29% > Generation 26% > Quality 24% > Understanding 20%.
So what: Team relies most on Improvement/Generation—the same areas with strongest ROI (see next section).
Next step: Double-down enablement and prompt packs for Improvement & Generation; encourage secondary use (e.g., add Testing/Quality asks after generation).
3) Efficiency by Category (story-point weighted)
Improvement: 8% Generation: 7% Quality: 4% Understanding: 4%.
So what: Copilot pays off most when writing or upgrading code; returns are lower for quality/understanding-only tasks.
Next step:
Make Improvement and Generation the “default Copilot lanes” for engineers.
For Quality/Understanding, supplement with structured checklists or automated review bots to convert “no reduction” cases into “slight/moderate”.
4) Efficiency by Story Points
Peaks: 13-point stories 11%, and 5/8-point stories 8%.
Low impact: 1–3 SP 5–6%; 6 SP and 30 SP currently 0%.
So what: Mid-sized stories are the Copilot sweet spot. Very small tasks are already fast; very large tasks need better decomposition/context.
Next step: Encourage splitting large stories; set an expectation that 5–13 SP stories use Copilot with multi-category prompts (gen + improve + tests).
5) Efficiency by Ticket Size (aggregated)
Medium: 7%, Large: 7%, Small: 5% (by story-point weighting).
So what: Despite higher adoption on larger work, small tickets underperform on ROI; medium/large can do even better with better prompts/context.
Next step: Provide prompt recipes for medium/large tickets (e.g., “generate + refactor + create tests”) and skip low-value Copilot usage on trivial small tickets.
6) Adoption × Time-reduction mix
Counts: Not used 264, Significant 56, Moderate 96, Slight 322, No reduction 67.
 (That’s ~7% significant, 12% moderate, 40% slight, 8% no reduction, 32% not used.)
So what: Most Copilot-used issues land in slight/moderate buckets; significant is rare.
Next step (high-leverage): Move slices of slight → moderate and moderate → significant with better prompting & context injection.
7) Usage by Ticket Size × Category (shares within each size)
Small: “Not applicable” 35% (i.e., many small issues skip Copilot).
Medium: balanced use across categories (17–24%).
Large: lowest “not applicable” (9%); Improvement dominates (39%).
So what: Engineers already reach for Copilot on larger work—good—but we’re leaving easy wins on the table in small tickets where generation + tests can be quick wins.
Next step: Where small tickets are repetitive (CRUD, stubs, tests), ship one-click prompt templates so devs get “instant” value.


Targeted actions (mapped to efficiency lift)
Scale the winners (Generation & Improvement)


Action: Publish 6–8 prompt recipes (new module scaffolding, API handler + tests, refactor for readability/perf, migration fixups).


Expected lift: even a 10% conversion of “slight” → “moderate” within used issues adds ~0.6 pp to average time saved among Copilot-used issues (and ~0.4 pp across all issues).
 If “slight” → “significant” for the same 10%, the lift is ~1.2 pp (used) / 0.8 pp (all).


Decompose large/30-SP stories


Action: Policy: break 30-SP stories into 5–13 SP sub-stories (where your data peaks at 8–11% gains).


Expected lift: converts zero-gain 30-SP work into 8–11% territory.


Raise the floor for small tickets


Action: For repetitive small tickets, standardize “gen + tests” micro-prompts (one launcher per repo).
Expected lift: moving small from 5% → 6–7% can matter because they’re numerous; this also frees attention for bigger tasks.


Fix the bimodal “Quality” category


Your time distribution shows Quality has 31% significant and 31% no reduction—i.e., inconsistent ROI.
Action: Add guardrails (lint/fix prompts, static-analysis summaries, PR review checklists) so quality tasks don’t fall to “no reduction”.
Expected lift: converting just 10% of “no reduction” quality issues to slight adds measurable points.


Shrink the “not used” pool with intent


Action: For the 32% not used, only target the applicable subset (e.g., bugs, refactors, new endpoints).
Expected lift: converting 10% of “not used” to moderate (15%) adds roughly +0.48 pp to average time saved across all issues.
What to track next (to prove the lift)
Adoption × Impact funnel: % Used → % Significant/Moderate/Slight (trend by sprint).
Category ROI: Efficiency by category and by multi-category usage on a ticket.
Size ROI: Efficiency by SP buckets (1,2,3,5,8,13,30) and ticket size (small/medium/large).
“What-if” scorecard: Show the effect of shifting portions of slight → moderate and not used → moderate each sprint (using the 25/15/5% rubric).
TL;DR leadership message
We’re at 68% adoption and ~7% efficiency overall.
Concentrate on Code Improvement & Generation and mid-sized stories to move efficiency fastest.
Apply prompt packs, ticket decomposition, and QA guardrails to lift “slight” to “moderate/significant.”


















🔹 1. Internal Codebase Complexity & Libraries
Challenge: Copilot works best with well-known open-source patterns, but enterprise teams often use custom internal libraries, frameworks, or DSLs. Since Copilot has less context on these, suggestions are weaker.


Efficiency Impact:
Developers spend time rejecting/refactoring irrelevant Copilot code.
Gains from repetitive/common UI or service layer code are low because internal frameworks differ.


👉 Next Step: Fine-tune Copilot on internal codebase or build prompt templates (e.g., “Write controller using our BaseController pattern”) to help Copilot adapt.

🔹 3. Lack of Standardization in Coding Practices
Challenge: If teams don’t have consistent coding guidelines or architecture patterns, Copilot produces inconsistent code.


Efficiency Impact:
More review cycles needed → productivity drops.
Junior engineers might rely too much, producing inconsistent PRs.
👉 Next Step: Establish strong code standards + enforce via linters/PR checks, so Copilot outputs are aligned.🔹 4. Context Switching & Limited History
Challenge: Copilot does not always understand Jira ticket context, design docs, or commit history.
Efficiency Impact:
Developers spend time “re-explaining” context inside comments.
Suggestions miss business logic (e.g., “validation must match product rules”).
👉 Next Step: Connect Jira + GitLab metadata into Copilot (through plugins/extensions), so AI suggestions are contextual.
🔹 5. Legacy Code & Monolithic Systems
Challenge: Enterprises often have legacy monoliths with outdated patterns. Copilot is better with modern modular code.


Efficiency Impact:
Developers spend more time fixing/refactoring AI output than writing directly.
Gains are seen only in greenfield or microservice areas, not old modules.
👉 Next Step: Prioritize Copilot adoption on new projects/microservices first.
🔹 7. Developer Mindset & Adoption Curve
Challenge: Senior devs may resist Copilot (“I code faster without it”), juniors may over-rely.


Efficiency Impact:
Uneven adoption → partial team gains.
Net productivity impact gets diluted.


👉 Next Step: Run structured adoption pilots + share internal success stories (ex: “UI tickets reduced by 30% dev time with Copilot”).

✅ Efficiency-Specific Pain Points (Summary)
Internal libraries not understood by Copilot → low gains.
No Jira/GitLab context integration → Copilot lacks business logic awareness.
Legacy code lowers suggestion quality → slows adoption.
ROI not measured → leadership skeptical.
Security/IP concerns → restrict usage.

“Our biggest blockers to efficiency are: Copilot not learning our internal libraries, lack of Jira/GitLab context, and limited adoption in legacy systems. If we fix these, efficiency gains could scale 2–3x beyond current levels.”
