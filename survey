uild Survey Detail Page (Owner/Admin View)

Build a Survey Detail Page in React 18 + TypeScript with Zustand state management and React Router.
APIs are already defined (GET /api/surveys/{id}, GET /api/surveys/{id}/responses/summary, GET /api/surveys/{id}/responses/{assignee}).

Layout & Components
1. Header Section (Overview)

Show survey metadata:

Name, Code, Deadline, Status, Owner

Show KPIs:

Total Assigned, Completed, Avg Completion Time

Status pill (OPEN / CLOSED)

2. Template Info (Collapsible)

By default, show only:

Template Name, Version, Created By

Hide questions until user clicks “View Questions” → expand list of all questions from template.

3. Assignments Table

Columns:

Assignee (kerberos or name)

Status (PENDING, DRAFT, SUBMITTED, DISCARDED)

Email Status (SENT, FAILED)

Submitted At (if available)

Row clickable → opens Response Modal.

4. Results / Summary Section

Show aggregated stats from GET /api/surveys/{id}/responses/summary:

Completed count / total

Avg completion time

Last submission date

Per-question breakdown:

For multiple choice → show counts & percentage (bar/pie chart).

For text questions → list top responses or word cloud.

Future slot: AI-generated summary (display placeholder box).

5. Response Modal (Drawer)

Triggered by clicking on an assignment row.

API: GET /api/surveys/{id}/responses/{assignee}

Modal content:

Assignee + submission status + submittedAt

Q&A view (Question text + selected option(s) + answerText)

Include “Open Full Page” button → navigates to /surveys/{id}/responses/{assignee}

Modal closable → return to assignment table context.
