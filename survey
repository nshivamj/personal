Backend Logic Summary
🔹 1. Core Collections (MongoDB)

surveyTemplates (Phase 2) → Predefined or dynamic templates with question sets.

surveys → Survey instance for a project (includes embedded assignments & questions).

surveyResponses → Responses submitted by users (separate collection, grows over time).

🔹 2. Survey Lifecycle (Flow)
Create Survey (Admin/Owner)

Admin calls POST /api/surveys with:

projectId, deadline, isAnonymous, templateId, assignments.

Backend:

Loads template (for MVP1: from static seeded data).

Copies (snapshots) questions into survey.questions.

Embeds assignments (<50 users) inside survey doc.

Saves survey.

👉 Result: a frozen survey doc with metadata, assignments, and questions.

User Workflow

List my surveys → GET /api/surveys/assigned

Backend looks at JWT → fetches surveys where assignments.userId = me.

Get my questions → GET /api/surveys/{id}/questions

Backend filters survey.questions by user’s role (targetRoles).

Submit responses → POST /api/surveys/{id}/responses

User submits all answers at once.

Backend saves docs in surveyResponses.

Marks assignments.status = COMPLETED.

Admin/Owner Reporting

View responses (raw, per user) → GET /api/surveys/{id}/responses

Joins surveyResponses + survey.questions for human-readable results.

Groups by user.

Drill down into one user → GET /api/surveys/{id}/responses/{userId}

Shows all answers of that user.

View aggregated results → GET /api/surveys/{id}/results

For choice questions → counts per option.

For text questions → returns list of answers.

Export results → GET /api/surveys/{id}/export?format=csv

Backend aggregates results and streams a CSV/Excel file.

🔹 3. Access Control

Normal Users (Stakeholders):

Can only access their assigned surveys/questions.

Can only submit their own responses.

Admins/Owners:

Can create/close surveys.

Can view all responses and results.

👉 Enforced via JWT/SSO roles in Spring Security.

🔹 4. API Summary
Survey Management

POST /surveys → Create from template.

GET /surveys?createdBy=me → My created surveys.

GET /surveys/{id} → Survey details (admin only).

PATCH /surveys/{id}/close → Close survey.

Assignment

GET /surveys/assigned → Surveys assigned to logged-in user.

Questions & Responses

GET /surveys/{id}/questions → My questions (filtered by role).

POST /surveys/{id}/responses → Submit all responses (atomic).

Reporting (Admin/Owner only)

GET /surveys/{id}/responses → All raw responses (grouped by user).

GET /surveys/{id}/responses/{userId} → One user’s responses.

GET /surveys/{id}/results → Aggregated summary.

GET /surveys/{id}/export?format=csv → Export to CSV/Excel.

Templates (Phase 2)

/templates → CRUD endpoints.

🔹 5. Service Layer (Spring Boot)

SurveyService

createSurveyFromTemplate(templateId, projectId, assignments, deadline)

getSurvey(surveyId)

listSurveysByOwner(ownerId)

closeSurvey(surveyId)

AssignmentService

getSurveysAssignedToUser(userId)

markAssignmentCompleted(surveyId, userId)

QuestionService

getQuestionsForUser(surveyId, userId)

ResponseService

submitResponses(surveyId, userId, answers[])

getResponsesForSurvey(surveyId)

getResponsesForUser(surveyId, userId)

getAggregatedResults(surveyId)

exportResultsToCSV(surveyId)

🔹 6. MongoDB Design Choices

Assignments → embedded (small, <50 per survey).

Questions → embedded (snapshotted at survey creation).

Responses → separate collection (potentially large, grows over time).

This balances simplicity (small data embedded) with scalability (large data separated).

✅ Backend Logic in One Sentence

👉 Admins create surveys from predefined templates (snapshotting questions), assign them to users (embedded), users fetch & submit all responses at once (stored separately), and admins later view results (raw per-user or aggregated), with strict role-based access.

Would you like me to now put this into a visual architecture diagram (services + collections + APIs) so you can show it to your team/stakeholders?

You said:
what abt colelctions model thtt is skipped
ChatGPT said:

Ah yes 👍 you’re right — so far I summarized the backend flow & APIs, but I didn’t give you the final Mongo collections schema in one place. Let’s fix that and finalize the collections model (MVP1, with template-based survey creation, assignments embedded, responses separate).

📂 Final MongoDB Collections Model
1. surveyTemplates (Phase 2 – dynamic, in MVP1 these are pre-seeded)

Holds reusable question sets.

{
  "_id": ObjectId("tpl1"),
  "name": "Audit Closure Survey",
  "description": "Standard audit closure feedback form",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "questionText": "Was the audit timeline realistic?",
      "type": "RADIO",                  
      "options": [
        { "id": "1", "text": "Yes" },
        { "id": "2", "text": "No" },
        { "id": "3", "text": "Partially" }
      ],
      "targetRoles": ["ALL"],
      "isMandatory": true
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "questionText": "Did your team face blockers?",
      "type": "TEXT",
      "options": [],
      "targetRoles": ["MANAGER","MEMBER"],
      "isMandatory": false
    }
  ],
  "createdBy": "U100",
  "createdAt": ISODate("2025-10-01T09:00:00Z")
}

2. surveys

Each instance of a survey tied to a project.

Embeds questions (snapshot from template).

Embeds assignments (<50 users).

{
  "_id": ObjectId("6501a1"),
  "projectId": "P1001",         // comes from external Project service
  "createdBy": "U100",          // from external User service
  "status": "OPEN",             // DRAFT, OPEN, CLOSED
  "deadline": ISODate("2025-10-15T00:00:00Z"),
  "isAnonymous": false,
  "assignments": [
    {
      "userId": "U200",
      "userRole": "MANAGER",
      "status": "PENDING",       // PENDING, COMPLETED
      "assignedAt": ISODate("2025-10-08T11:00:00Z"),
      "completedAt": null
    },
    {
      "userId": "U201",
      "userRole": "EXECUTIVE",
      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "assignedAt": ISODate("2025-10-08T11:05:00Z"),
      "completedAt": ISODate("2025-10-08T12:30:00Z")
    }
  ],
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "questionText": "Was the audit timeline realistic?",
      "type": "RADIO",
      "options": [
        { "id": "1", "text": "Yes" },
        { "id": "2", "text": "No" }
      ],
      "targetRoles": ["ALL"],
      "isMandatory": true
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "questionText": "Did your team face blockers?",
      "type": "TEXT",
      "options": [],
      "targetRoles": ["MANAGER","MEMBER"],
      "isMandatory": false
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": ISODate("2025-10-08T09:00:00Z")
}

3. surveyResponses

Separate collection since this can grow large.
Each doc = one answer to one question.

{
  "_id": ObjectId("r1"),
  "surveyId": ObjectId("6501a1"),
  "questionId": "q1",              // from survey.questions.id
  "userId": "U200",                // null if anonymous
  "answerOptionId": "1",           // reference from question.options
  "answerText": null,              // only for text answers
  "submittedAt": ISODate("2025-10-08T12:00:00Z")
}


Another example for text:

{
  "_id": ObjectId("r2"),
  "surveyId": ObjectId("6501a1"),
  "questionId": "q2",
  "userId": "U200",
  "answerOptionId": null,
  "answerText": "We had blockers from another team.",
  "submittedAt": ISODate("2025-10-08T12:00:00Z")
}

📊 Why This Model Works

surveyTemplates → reusable question sets, versioned, never edited after use.

surveys → snapshot questions + assignments, fully self-contained.

surveyResponses → scalable, supports analytics, easy to query/aggregate.

This matches global best practices:

Small & stable things (assignments, questions) embedded.

Large & growing things (responses) separated.

👉 Do you want me to now map each API → to the Mongo collection(s) + queries/aggregations it will hit? That way you’ll have a clear data access plan for your devs.

You said:
surveyr repsonse show for multiple users and ques
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👍 let’s illustrate how surveyResponses will look in Mongo when you have multiple users answering multiple questions for the same survey.

📂 Example: Survey with 2 Questions, 3 Users
Survey (6501a1)

Q1: "Was the audit timeline realistic?" (RADIO: Yes/No/Partially)

Q2: "Did your team face blockers?" (TEXT)

Assignments

U200 → MANAGER

U201 → EXECUTIVE

U202 → MEMBER

📑 surveyResponses Collection

Each response = 1 user’s answer to 1 question.
So 3 users × 2 questions = 6 response docs.

[
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("r1"),
    "surveyId": ObjectId("6501a1"),
    "questionId": "q1",
    "userId": "U200",
    "answerOptionId": "1",     // Yes
    "answerText": null,
    "submittedAt": ISODate("2025-10-08T12:00:00Z")
  },
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("r2"),
    "surveyId": ObjectId("6501a1"),
    "questionId": "q2",
    "userId": "U200",
    "answerOptionId": null,
    "answerText": "We faced dependency blockers.",
    "submittedAt": ISODate("2025-10-08T12:00:00Z")
  },
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("r3"),
    "surveyId": ObjectId("6501a1"),
    "questionId": "q1",
    "userId": "U201",
    "answerOptionId": "2",     // No
    "answerText": null,
    "submittedAt": ISODate("2025-10-08T12:10:00Z")
  },
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("r4"),
    "surveyId": ObjectId("6501a1"),
    "questionId": "q2",
    "userId": "U201",
    "answerOptionId": null,
    "answerText": "No blockers at leadership level.",
    "submittedAt": ISODate("2025-10-08T12:10:00Z")
  },
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("r5"),
    "surveyId": ObjectId("6501a1"),
    "questionId": "q1",
    "userId": "U202",
    "answerOptionId": "3",     // Partially
    "answerText": null,
    "submittedAt": ISODate("2025-10-08T12:20:00Z")
  },
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("r6"),
    "surveyId": ObjectId("6501a1"),
    "questionId": "q2",
    "userId": "U202",
    "answerOptionId": null,
    "answerText": "Some minor blockers, but manageable.",
    "submittedAt": ISODate("2025-10-08T12:20:00Z")
  }
]

📊 How Admin Will See It
Per User View

U200 (Manager)

Q1 → Yes

Q2 → "We faced dependency blockers."

U201 (Executive)

Q1 → No

Q2 → "No blockers at leadership level."

U202 (Member)

Q1 → Partially

Q2 → "Some minor blockers, but manageable."

Aggregated View

Q1: Was the audit timeline realistic?

Yes → 1

No → 1

Partially → 1

Q2: Did your team face blockers?

"We faced dependency blockers."

"No blockers at leadership level."

"Some minor blockers, but manageable."

✅ This structure makes it easy to:

Fetch all responses by survey (group by user).

Fetch all responses by user (for drilldown).

Fetch aggregated results per question (counts for radio/checkbox, raw text for free-form).

👉 Do you want me to also show the Mongo aggregation pipeline to get:

Responses grouped per user

Responses aggregated per question

That way your reporting API (/results and /responses) is already defined in backend logic?

You said:
now can you write a promt for loveable app to build this UI, can use relevant react redux saga for api integration base don apis defined above
ChatGPT said:

Got it 🚀 — you want a prompt for Lovable (the AI app builder) so it generates your UI with React + Redux-Saga + API integration based on the backend APIs we defined.

Here’s a polished prompt you can drop directly into Lovable:

💡 Prompt for Lovable (React + Redux-Saga Survey App)

App Goal:
Build a web-based Audit Survey Application where Admins/Owners can create and manage surveys (from predefined templates), assign them to users, track completion, and view results. Users can view assigned surveys, answer questions, and submit responses.
